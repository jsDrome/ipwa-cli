## How this works

All you need to do is spin up a new project, sign up to a few providers, set the tokens and secrets correctly and the rest is all magic. When you push code to master, it will just be deployed everywhere in 10 minutes after a series of checks.

## Setup Project

1. Install ipwa - `npm i -g ipwa`
2. Spawn a new ipwa app - `ipwa my-app`
3. Create new firebase project and set `FIREBASE_APP_NAME` and `FIREBASE_TOKEN` secrets
4. Create new heroku app and set `HEROKU_APP_NAME` and `HEROKU_API_KEY` secrets
5. Integrate project with Codecov and set `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret
6. Sign up to Docker and set `DOCKER_USER` and `DOCKER_PASS` secrets, also set `GITHUB_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME` & `DOCKERHUB_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME` in `./.github/workflows/build-master.yml`.
7. Run npm run test:cypress:open, create a new project and set `CYPRESS_PROJECT_ID` and `CYPRESS_TOKEN` secrets
8. Set your stage url in .configrc
9. Integrate project with Percy and set `PERCY_TOKEN` env variable
10. Sign up to npm and set `NPM_TOKEN`
11. Sign up to expo and set `EXPO_USERNAME` and `EXPO_PASS`
11. Create new Github project, make sure Github actions are enabled, initiate, add, commit, push.


# Detailed Instructions
