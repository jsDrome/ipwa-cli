## How this works

All you need to do is spin up a new project, sign up to a few providers, set the tokens and secrets correctly and the rest is all magic. When you push code to master, it will just be deployed everywhere in 10 minutes after a series of checks.

## Setup Project

1. Install jsDrome

```shell
npm i -g jsdrome
```

2. Spawn a new jsdrome app.

```shell
jsdrome my-app
```

3. You need to sign up for: Codecov, Cypress, Percy, Dockerhub, Heroku, Firebase and npm and get the respective tokens.

4. Set the environment secrets in Github.

5. Push
