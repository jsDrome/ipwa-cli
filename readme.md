# iPWA

üöÄ Spin up an isomorphic progressive web app or native app deployable in the cloud, publishable as an npm package or docker container with a fully automated supercharged pipeline, all in under an hour, so you can focus on creating stuff!

## How this works

This package was created with automated pipeline in mind. One codebase for web and native apps where when something gets merged to master, it gets to production. All you need to do is spin up a new project, set the tokens and secrets correctly and the rest is all magic. When you push code to master, it will just be deployed everywhere after a series of checks. What happens behind the scene is once you push code to Github, it triggers Github actions. If its the master branch, it runs a basic Sanity Check where it builds the client and server code base, runs lint and unittests and reports to Codecov. This sanity check is followed by staging in Heroku. The application is dockerized and deployed as a docker container on Heroku. Once done, regression tests are performed on this staging environment. Unit tests, Cypress tests, Puppeteer and Percy visual regression tests are performed on this environment. Once passed, the docker image is pushed to Dockerhub and Github Container Registry, deployed into Firebase and published to Expo as over-the-air update. To top it all, its published to npm as well.

## Setup Project

Install ipwa globally

```shell
npm i -g ipwa
```

Create a new ipwa app

```shell
ipwa my-app install
```
This will create a new project called my-app in the current directory and install npm dependencies.

Create a new project in Github. Do not push anything yet.

Create new Codecov app and set `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret in Github. This is where our unit test reports are stored.

Create new Heroku app and set `HEROKU_APP_NAME` in `./.github/workflows/build-master.yml` and `HEROKU_API_KEY` secret in Github. This is where our app will be staged.

Set `config_environment__STAGE_URL` environment variable or set `STAGE_URL` in `.configrc`

Run `npm run test:cypress:open`, create a new project in Cypress and set `CYPRESS_PROJECT_ID` and `CYPRESS_TOKEN` secrets in Github.

Create new Percy app and set `PERCY_TOKEN` secrets in Github. This is where our visual regression test reports are stored.

Sign up to Docker and set `DOCKER_USER` and `DOCKER_PASS` secrets in Github. This is where our docker image is pushed.

Set `GITHUB_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME` & `DOCKERHUB_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME` in `./.github/workflows/build-master.yml`. The docker image above will be pushed to Github package registry as well.

Sign up to npm and set `NPM_TOKEN` secret in Github.

Sign up to expo and set `EXPO_CLI_USERNAME` and `EXPO_CLI_PASSWORD` secrets in Github. This is where our expo app will be published.

Create new firebase app and set `FIREBASE_APP_NAME` in `./.github/workflows/build-master.yml` and `FIREBASE_TOKEN` secrets in Github. This will be our production environment.

Push the new project you just created to Github.
